  "description": "The ConnectionDrainingPolicy property describes how deregistered or unhealthy instances handle in-flight requests for the AWS::ElasticLoadBalancing::LoadBalancer resource. Connection draining ensures that the load balancer completes serving all in-flight requests made to a registered instance when the instance is deregistered or becomes unhealthy. Without connection draining, the load balancer closes connections to deregistered or unhealthy instances, and any in-flight requests are not completed.",
